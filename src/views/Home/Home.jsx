      <p>Demonstration of Git</p>

      <ul>
        <li>First you'll need to configure the project for debugging via the launch.json file</li>
        <li>Then you'll start the project using F5</li>
        <li>After this you can try adding breakpoints to the RecipeApi or TodoApp components or their child components</li>
        <li>Use those breakpoints to monitor variables and step over or into statements using F10 and F11</li>
      </ul>
